<h3>🧠 Agent Bhargav — “Backend Commander”</h3>

<p><b>Total 4 tasks with weightage provided too:</b></p>

<p>1. As I know Backend (not perfect tho - revise it plz), do one of these (Anyone of these done would addup 25%)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Build a secure API<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Agentic AI n8n project<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) One open source contribution (the pr should be merged)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)
</p>

<p class="note">🎯 Agent Bhargav, (iv) is still blank, soldier! The battlefield demands clarity — fill that gap with something heroic. 🪖</p>

<p>2. Languages to learn - Go (One GitHub repo where the code is more than 50% written in go), React (Maximuller), Angular (Coursera), Django (Coursera) (each 6.25%)</p>

<p class="note">💥 Four frameworks? That’s not a roadmap — that’s a minefield. Hope you conquered at least one of these territories instead of retreating after “npm start.” 😎</p>

<p>3. Atleast 75 problems on LeetCode, Watch striver's playlist and prepare notes (75 problems - 10%, notes - 15%)</p>

<p class="note">🧩 Code drills mandatory, Captain. If recursion still haunts your dreams, push through the pain — it’s not infinite, only feels that way. 🌀</p>

<p>4. Improve NLP Knowledgebase (+1 project and should be in GitHub) (25% if the model is trained and could run)</p>

<p class="note">🤖 If your model still shouts “CUDA out of memory,” consider it your training montage moment. If it runs, welcome to the Neural Legion, soldier. 🧠</p>

<p><b>Small Talk for myself:</b><br>
Never lose hope, never wait for the next train, your cgpa was draining, there were dhokebaaz log lingering around you, you might eventually reduce the time that you waste and the number of friends you had, remember virat was still touching the outside the offstump balls. Still nothing has gone completely wrong, nothing will ever push you lower than any lowest stage of your life, ride the time, jump across the seas, trust in god, always be patient and humble, never take anything granted, same as previously, always keep pushing beyond the limits and not even sky is your barr
</p>

<p class="note">📜 Words worthy of a commander’s creed. Future Bhargav — re-read this before every deploy, before every bug fix, and before every coffee. This is your war chant. ⚔️</p>

<h3>🛠️ Agent Dhrupad — “The Systems Architect”</h3>

<p>Different architectural 3 good projects with practical sense<br>
DevOps/MLOps(even if basic)<br>
Cloud(even if basic)<br>
Dsa + competitive (atleast 100 questions all over)</p>

<p class="note">🏗️ Commander Dhrupad, if your 3 “architectural” projects still look like To-Do Apps in disguise — we will demote you to UI Private. 100 problems? Respect — but Two Sum doesn’t count, soldier! 🫡</p>

<p class="note">☁️ DevOps, MLOps, Cloud — that’s the holy trinity of modern engineering warfare. If you’ve set up even a single working CI/CD pipeline that didn’t explode mid-deploy, salute to you, Chief. 💾</p>

<p class="note">💡 Your code should now look like blueprints — structured, scalable, and indestructible. The enemy? “Works on my machine.” The mission? Make it work on *every* machine. 💥</p>

<p class="note">🧠 By this time, you should be the kind of engineer who looks at a broken system and says, “Yeah, I can containerize that.” And actually does it. Docker General, Cloud Colonel, Architect Supreme — titles await you. 🫡</p>

<p class="note">🔥 Your motto: “Design like an architect. Debug like a mercenary.” If you’ve mastered that — mission accomplished, soldier.</p>

<p class="note">💣 This isn’t a to-do list, it’s an *entire war campaign*. Future Divyansh — if even 50% is conquered, build your own statue out of silicon. Respect. 🏆</p>

<p class="note">🧬 You probably built more circuits than sleep cycles. If your FPGA project worked on first try, it wasn’t luck — it was destiny. Future hardware gods salute you. ⚙️</p>

<h3>📡 Final Transmission — To All Future Operatives</h3>

<p class="note">💬 Comrades,  
You’ve survived the chaos of deadlines, debugging, burnout, and betrayal by semicolons. If all missions were completed — medals await you.  
If not — the fight isn’t over. Each failed commit was just a test run for greatness.  
Keep pushing, stay alert, stay humble, and remember: **Bhargav still owes everyone chai. ☕**
